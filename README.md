# Network Project 01 


**Objectives**

In this project we want to focus on network concepts that could be used to develop applications.

**Concepts**

These concepts
| Concept   |      Resources      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| IP Adresses |  res01 |
| Host/Domain Name |    [Lenovo documention of what is a host name ](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/glossary/hostname/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)   |
| InetAddress Package (Java) | [InetAddress Documentaion](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html) |



**Problem**

Develop a method that takes a host name as an input and returnes its ip address.

**Implementation**

Write the implementation of the `getIpByHostName` method. After that, call it with a valid input.
```Java
public static String getIpByHostName(String hostName){
    String ipAddress = null;
    /* Your code here */
    return ipAddress;
}
```

<!-- **Bonus** 
- Let the app run until the user insert `close`.
- Add another feature that takes an IP Address and returns its corresponding host name. -->
